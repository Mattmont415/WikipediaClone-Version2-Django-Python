# Django

Django is a web framework written using [Python](/wiki/Python) that allows for the design of web applications that generate [HTML](/wiki/HTML) dynamically.

Also, even though "Django" starts with the letter, 'D', it is silent, and therefore the pronunciation of the word is simply 'jango'
